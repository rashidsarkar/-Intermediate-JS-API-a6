      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold">Discuss the scope of var, let, and const</h2>
      <p>
        In JavaScript, the scope of variables declared with <code>var</code>, <code>let</code>, and <code>const</code>
        differs. Here's a brief overview:
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong><code>var</code>:</strong> Variables declared with <code>var</code> are function-scoped. This means they
        are limited to the function in which they are defined or are globally scoped if declared outside of any
        function.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong><code>let</code>:</strong> Variables declared with <code>let</code> are block-scoped. They are limited
        to the block (usually enclosed in curly braces) in which they are defined, like if statements or loops.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong><code>const</code>:</strong> Like <code>let</code>, variables declared with <code>const</code> are
        block-scoped. However, they cannot be reassigned once a value is assigned to them, making them useful for
        defining constants.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold">Tell us the use cases of null and undefined</h2>
      <p>
        <strong><code>null</code>:</strong> In JavaScript, <code>null</code> is a special value that represents the
        intentional absence of any object value. It is often used to indicate that a variable should have no value or
        that an object property is intentionally empty.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong><code>undefined</code>:</strong> <code>undefined</code> represents a variable that has been declared but
        has not been assigned any value. It is also the default return value of functions that do not explicitly return
        anything.
      </p>
      <p>
        Use cases for <code>null</code> and <code>undefined</code> include error handling, initialization of variables,
        and checking if a variable has a meaningful value.

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold">What do you mean by REST API?</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>REST API</strong>, which stands for Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface,
        is an architectural style for designing networked applications. It is based on a set of constraints and
        principles that encourage a stateless, client-server communication model.
      </p>
      <p>
        REST APIs use HTTP methods (such as GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to perform operations on resources identified by
        URLs (Uniform Resource Locators). These resources can be data objects, services, or entities, and they are
        manipulated using standard HTTP requests.
      </p>
      <p>
        RESTful APIs are known for their simplicity, scalability, and ease of use, making them a popular choice for
        building web services and APIs that can be consumed by various clients, including web browsers and mobile
        applications.
